The below works.

Mac Os: ** Using single file --onefile flag worked but the load time was greatly increased
on my old mac intel. Maybe not an issue on newer macs? Will have to test on my kid's M1 Mac Mini.

pyinstaller --noconfirm --add-data "/usr/local/Cellar/qt/6.7.3/share/qt/plugins/platforms:PySide6/Qt/plugins/platforms" --add-data "/usr/local/Cellar/qt/6.7.3/share/qt/plugins/multimedia:PySide6/Qt/plugins/multimedia" --windowed tesla_dashcam_viewer.py

Or much slower loading single file distribution

pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --add-data "/usr/local/Cellar/qt/6.7.3/share/qt/plugins/platforms:PySide6/Qt/plugins/platforms" --add-data "/usr/local/Cellar/qt/6.7.3/share/qt/plugins/multimedia:PySide6/Qt/plugins/multimedia" --windowed tesla_dashcam_viewer.py




Windows: For some reason everything is detect automaticlly unlike my Intel Mac.
pyinstaller --noconfirm --windowed tesla_dashcam_viewer.py

OR for a single file, it seems to load quickly.
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed tesla_dashcam_viewer.py
